## Application Context 
There are many mobile applications regarding fitness and mental health, but it’s difficult to find one application that has special attention to both. But the hope isn’t lost, and our application comes to help you stay fit and, at the same time, keep your mind clean.  
The intention of this application comes when there is an undeniable boom in fitness routine whilst mental health is becoming more and more an important matter of our daily lives.  
That being said, we come to address both problems where they can intuitively connect with each other, either by promoting healthier lifestyles or even promoting good and positive energies to visitors.  
  
Fuelness comes from the combination of two different words, fuel and fullness. Fuel represents the strength and energy that you need for your both physical and mental health. Fulness, remembers the calm, relaxed and positive posture that you should have when facing a problem in your life. <br>

> “Health is a state of complete harmony of the body, mind and spirit. When one is free from physical disabilities and mental distractions, the gates of the soul open.” -  B.K.S. Iyengar

## Application Purpose
Fuelness’ main objective is to provide a simple, intuitive and efficient way for users to keep track of their daily steps, as well as physical activities (e.g., running), but at the same time, they can keep their deepest thoughts in a private journal, by notes (these ones could be by text, audio or video).  

* **Daily Steps**: track your daily steps, the corresponding kilometers and calories spent on that day.  
* **Weekly steps**: it’s brought to the user a statistical approach by showing a weekly steps chart to users where they can see their improvements and continue to be motivated.
* **Activities**: the user can choose from both indoors and outdoors activities, like running or cycling. It registers various details, like the location of the training session, the location path of that session, the kilometers made and how many calories were lost.
* **Guide**: here we provide hints to users when they don’t really know where to start while promoting good mentorship to beginners.
* **Private Journal**: it is a safe place for the users, where they can express their deepest thoughts and concerns. This expression made by the user could be by text, audio or video. This section helps the consumer to write or say something out loud, and feel like a huge weight was lifted from their shoulders.
* **Alarm with Daily Quote**: concerning mental health, the user can set up an alarm for a daily quote. This quote can be adapted by a tag depending on the context of the day, i.e, friday afternoon. This feature asks the users how are they feeling and the users the options that suit them the most, and based on that we will give different quotes. Case scenario example:  users can set up an alarm for every business day in the morning to lift up their spirit and to give them strength to face the day.
